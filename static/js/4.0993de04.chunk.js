With Redux, it takes some time to understand its patterns and paradigms plus its combination of Flux architecture and functional programming concepts. For functional programmers, it may be easier to grasp Redux, whereas for someone from an object-oriented programming background, Redux code can initially look complex and hard to understand. Learning Redux also means you need to learn about Redux middleware like Thunk and Saga, adding more material and time to learn. On the other hand, MobX is known to be easier to learn compared to Redux. Most JavaScript developers are well versed in object-oriented programming, which makes learning MobX simple. Also, there are a lot of things that are done behind the scenes in MobX, creating a better learning experience for the developers.
